MusicMeta is a tiny utility that allows you to scan a music collection, extracting metadata to a separate file. 

The output contians the path/filename plus the extracted metadata, allowing you to compare the two. This can be useful when crappy players mixes up the metadata; future plans include file rename as well as metadata editing.

The tool is free to use, and uses TagLibSharp for metadata extraction.
